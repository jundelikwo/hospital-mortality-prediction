# In Hospital Mortality Prediction

The predictors of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.

This project attempts to create a classifier that can identify patients that will die or remain alive based on certain parameters.
